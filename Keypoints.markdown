Note  :
  #1 : So now i have to make a few small touches to the cards lke the lessons and maybe also the durations stuff because i find it a bit weird but that is just me  
  #2 : The Points card--make each course have its own point worth or something like that.
  #3 : start the instructor side of the admin site


Okay so everything that i have implemented is working biut it is not working the way i want it to work for starters the courses page is messed up i havent still been able to find a reasonable logic for the whole courses section so i need to find the best way to embody all of this as soon as possible i also have to take a couple of courses on the mern stack and i also have to work on the admin part taht section is still pretty messed up so that is another one all i all i would love to have all of that sorted out today and more because time is of the essence.
